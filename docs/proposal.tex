  \opening{Dear Dr.~Urbain:}

  We are writing you today to inform you of our proposal for our final project in the  SE\,4910 Mobile Application Development course.

  We propose the development of a mobile weather application called ``Rain?''.
  This application will use the \href{https://darksky.net}{Dark Sky} API to get hyperlocal weather data.
  It shall have specified ranges of weather conditions and present to the user a prose-like textual description of the current weather conditions.
  We will also add a homescreen widget so that our users do not need to open the application; they can simply look at their homescreen.
  In addition, there shall be a button that when clicked will speak the textual weather description to the user.

  \closing{Regards,}

  \ps

  P.S. We have also created a stretch goal for ourselves: when saying ``Okay Google, Rain?'' this application will open and present the current weather, or something similar.

\end{letter}
